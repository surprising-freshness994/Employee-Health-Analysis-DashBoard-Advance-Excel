# 🧠 Employee Health Data Cleaning & Dashboard Project

This project is a demonstration of my Excel-based data analysis skills applied to a simulated real-world employee health dataset. It includes a full data cleaning process, derived metrics, pivot table analysis, and dashboard setup. This work showcases my readiness for data analyst roles requiring precision, attention to detail, and actionable insight generation.

## 🎯 Project Objectives

- Clean a messy employee health dataset to make it usable
- Derive meaningful metrics using Excel formulas
- Categorize key variables (e.g., WorkHours, SleepHours, HeartRate, etc.)
- Build a pivot table to summarize departmental insights
- Create a dashboard layout for HR health monitoring

## 🧹 Data Cleaning Tasks Performed

- Removed ~500 duplicate rows from 10,500 records
- Corrected inconsistent labels (e.g., `Fmale` → `Female`, `Hr` → `HR`)
- Standardized case formatting and removed extra spaces
- Categorized numeric values using Excel `IF()` logic:
  - `WorkHoursStatus` — Overloaded / Normal / Others
  - `StressLevelStatus` — High / Moderate / Low
  - `SleepHoursStatus` — Well Rested / Moderate / Sleep Deprived
  - `HeartRateStatus` — High / Normal / Low
  - `StepCountStatus` — Highly Active / Active / Low Active / Sedentary
  - `ProductivityScoreStatus` — Excellent / Good / Average / Poor
- Calculated `NoOfDays` = LastLogin - DateOfJoining

## 📊 Pivot Table Insights

A pivot table was created to:
- Analyze average WorkHours by Department
- Segment employees by Stress Level and Productivity Score
- Observe StepCount activity trends

---

## 📈 Dashboard (in Excel)

The `DashBoard` sheet serves as a layout for:
- KPI cards (Avg WorkHours, Sleep, Stress, Productivity)
- Department-level breakdowns
- Visuals like bar charts, pie charts, and slicers (user can add)

## 🛠️ Tools Used

- **Microsoft Excel**
  - Advanced Formulas
  - Data Validation & Cleaning
  - Pivot Tables
  - Dashboard Setup

---

## 🧠 Skills Demonstrated

- Data Cleaning and Preprocessing
- Categorization of Numeric & Text Data
- Derived Column Creation
- Analytical Thinking for KPI Extraction
- Excel Dashboard Design

## 📌 How to Explore

1. Open the uncleaned dataset to view raw data issues
2. Compare with the cleaned version (`Main` sheet)
3. Explore the Pivot Table and use slicers for insights
4. Extend the Dashboard layout by adding visual charts
